        ISRO sent a lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, on 22 October 2008, which
        discovered lunar water in the form of ice,[21] and the Mars Orbiter
        Mission, on 5 November 2013, which entered Mars orbit on 24 September
        2014, making India the first nation to succeed on its maiden attempt to
        Mars, as well as the first space agency in Asia to reach Mars orbit.[22]
        On 18 June 2016, ISRO launched twenty satellites in a single
        vehicle,[23] and on 15 February 2017, ISRO launched one hundred and four
        satellites in a single rocket (PSLV-C37), a world record.[24][25] ISRO
        launched its heaviest rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch
        Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk III), on 5 June 2017 and placed a
        communications satellite GSAT-19 in orbit. With this launch, ISRO became
        capable of launching 4-tonne heavy satellites into GTO. On 22 July 2019,
        ISRO launched its second lunar mission Chandrayaan-2 to study the lunar
        geology and the distribution of lunar water.

        In 1950, the Department of Atomic Energy was founded with Bhabha as its
        secretary.[30] The department provided funding for space research
        throughout India.[31] During this time, tests continued on aspects of
        meteorology and the Earth's magnetic field, a topic that was being
        studied in India since the establishment of the observatory at Colaba in
        1823. In 1954, the Uttar Pradesh state observatory was established at
        the foothills of the Himalayas.[30] The Rangpur Observatory was set up
        in 1957 at Osmania University, Hyderabad. Space research was further
        encouraged by the government of India.[31] In 1957, the Soviet Union
        launched Sputnik 1 and opened up possibilities for the rest of the world
        to conduct a space launch.[31] The Indian National Committee for Space
        Research (INCOSPAR) was set up in 1962
