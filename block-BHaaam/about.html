        The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO, /ˈɪsroʊ/; Hindi: Bhārtīya
        Antrikṣa Anusandhān Saṅgaṭhan) is the space agency of the Government of
        India and has its headquarters in the city of Bangalore (also known as
        Bengaluru). Its vision is to "harness space technology for national
        development while pursuing space science research & planetary
        exploration".[6] The Indian National Committee for Space Research
        (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of
        Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, with the urging of scientist Vikram
        Sarabhai recognising the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and
        became ISRO in 1969, also under the DAE. In 1972, the Government of
        India had set up a Space Commission and the Department of Space (DOS),
        bringing ISRO under the DOS. The establishment of ISRO thus
        institutionalised space research activities in India. It is managed by
        the DOS, which reports to the Prime Minister of India
